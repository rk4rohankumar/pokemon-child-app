## Features
- Developed as a microfrontend for seamless integration with a parent application.
- Built with modern technologies like React and Tailwind CSS.
- Module Federation for dynamic sharing of code between apps.
- Responsive and optimized for performance.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override)**: For extending CRA configuration.
- **Webpack Module Federation**: For microfrontend architecture.

### Configuration Details
#### CRACO and Webpack
The project uses **CRACO** to customize the Webpack configuration for supporting Module Federation:
- **publicPath**: Set to `https://pokemon-child-app.vercel.app/` for deployment.
- **Module Federation Plugin**:
  - Name: `PokemonApp`
  - Remote Entry: `remoteEntry.js`
  - Exposes: `./PokemonApp` from `./src/App`
  - Shared Dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, and `tailwindcss`

### Deployment

## Microfrontend Integration
To consume this microfrontend in a parent application, include the following in your Module Federation configuration:
```javascript
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  remotes: {
    PokemonApp: 'PokemonApp@https://pokemon-child-app.vercel.app/remoteEntry.js',
  },
})
```

## Scripts
